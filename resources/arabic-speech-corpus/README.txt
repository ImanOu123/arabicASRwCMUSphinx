1- the subdirectory 'test-set' contains an extra 100 utterances which were used to test
   speech made by the utterances in 'main-corpus'. It was recorded in a different time
   so it might be slightly different in acoustic nad phonetic features.

2- The 'lab' subdirectories contain label files with the orthographic transcirpt in
   them. Note that the file 'orthographic-transcript.txt' is simply all the 'lab'
   files merged and paired with their corresponding wav file name.

3- The 'textgrid' subdirectories contain praat files with the phonetic transcirpt  and
   timetamps (alignments). Please read more online about the textgrid format. Note that
   the file 'phonetic-transcript.txt' is simply all the phonetic transcripts merged
   without timestamps paired with their corresponding wav file name.

4- In orthographic transcripts a pause is resembled with a '-'. In phonetic transcripts
   it is resembled with 'sil'.
   
5- Any corrupt phonemes are marked with 'dist'. the `schwa` is marked as '-' in the
   phonetic transcript only (not included in the orthographic).

6- For more details on the phonemes used, please refer to my PhD thesis on the website.
